    This BBQ ribs recipe may be different than others you've 
    tried, but for super tender ribs, give it a try! Lean, 
    country-style pork ribs are boiled in seasoned water until 
    tender, then finished up in the oven under a blanket of your 
    favorite barbecue sauce as they bake to perfection. That's it! 
    Back to simplicity, back to country life.
